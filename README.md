🚀 Features
📝 JSON Input & Validation

Users can paste or type raw JSON data into a text box.

When the “Generate Tree” button is clicked, the app validates the JSON structure.

If the JSON is invalid, an error message is displayed in red.

🌳 JSON Tree Visualization

Once valid JSON is provided, the data is visualized as a tree structure using React Flow.

Each key-value pair becomes a node in the tree.

The visualization supports panning, zooming, and dragging nodes.

🌗 Dark / Light Mode

A toggle switch allows users to seamlessly switch between dark mode and light mode.

The entire interface, including text and background, updates instantly to match the selected theme.

🔍 Search Functionality

Users can search for specific keys in the JSON data.

If a key is found, its corresponding node is highlighted in pink.
